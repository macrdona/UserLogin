#UserLogin

This application was written in python, and it makes use of a database to store user data and a json configuration file to save the database connection credentials.

In this application, users can create, log in and delete their accounts, as well as to change their password.
It implements various classes like Hash.py(which has a method to hash a user's password), Salt.py(which has a method that generates a random salt to provide to the hashing function), and Password.py(which uses regular expressions to make sure that a user's password meets certain conditions)

**NOTE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS APP WAS TO PRACTICE WORKING WITH A DATABASE, AND LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO SECURE USER'S DATA**
